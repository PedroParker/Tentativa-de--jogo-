# A python game for yours and ours fun

This game implements the idea of a Alice in bothernland game wich I don't remember the exact name srry :(

# Run
You have to run the server before runing the game. `python Server.py` for oppening the server, and now it is possible to run some game instances (just two is suported yet).
To run the game use `python Run.py` (or any other command you use to compile python files) in the folder that contains the files you just cloned (at the current stage this project don't do anything special tho, literally).
